# Spinnaker UI Plugin Examples

Example plugins for [Spinnaker's UI](https://github.com/spinnaker/deck).

## Try them out!

You can build these plugins by running `yarn && yarn build` or `yarn && yarn watch` from the
`deck-plugin-examples` directory.

You can run `DEV_PROXY_HOST=<spinnaker-ui-address> yarn proxy` to load your plugin into an existing Spinnaker installation. The proxy will auto-reload the browser when you re-build your plugin.
